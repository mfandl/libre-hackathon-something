# Tiny Little Something

A project made during a small libre hackathon organised by [fanna](https://github.com/fanna).

In case the name is not self explanatory, I don't know what this is supposed to be. At the end of a hackathon, this was a small realtime animation that's hard to describe.You can see it [live](http://tinylittlesomething.mladypes.sk/).

While the purpose of this project was to learn a technology, I'd be happy if it evolved into something that is a bit easier to describe.
